**Last Updated:** 30 Aug 2024

</div>

1. **Introduction**

   Welcome to External Secrets Inc. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of all the External Secrets Inc products ("Service"), including the software agents we provide ("Agent"), which you install and operate within your infrastructure. By using our Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

2. **Description of Service**

   External Secrets Inc provides a managed on-premises solution that enables you to securely manage and interact with your secret data within your own infrastructure. Our Agent is installed and operated within your environment, ensuring that sensitive information does not leave your control.

3. **Privacy and Data Handling**

   **No Access to Secret Data:** We do not have access to, nor do we collect or transmit, any secret data managed by the Agent within your infrastructure. The Service is designed to operate within your environment, and all sensitive data remains under your control.

   **Data Collected:** We only collect data necessary to communicate with you, provide customer support, bill for our services, and give you insights about your Secrets Management infrastructure. This may include contact information, billing information, and usage statistics related to the operation of the Agent and your infrastructure.

   **Data Disposal:** Upon termination of your use of the Service, and following any applicable data retention periods required by law, we will dispose of your personal and billing data in a secure manner.

4. **Alpha Testing and Design Partners**

   If you are participating as an alpha tester or design partner, you acknowledge that the Service may be in an early stage of development. As such:

   **No Guarantees:** We cannot guarantee that the Service will function correctly, and you may experience bugs, errors, or other issues.

   **Changes and Updates:** The Service is subject to frequent changes, which may include new features, modifications, or the removal of existing features. We may not provide advance notice of these changes.

   **Use at Your Own Risk:** You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service as an alpha tester or design partner is at your own risk, and External Secrets Inc is not liable for any damages or losses you may incur as a result.

5. **Pricing and Changes**

   **Pricing:** Our pricing is subject to change. We will notify you of any changes to pricing or billing terms in advance.

   **Fee Adjustments:** We reserve the right to adjust fees, charges, and pricing plans. Changes to pricing will not apply retroactively to periods before the change.

6. **Limitation of Liability**

   **No Warranties:** The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted during alpha, beta, or early access phases.

   **Limited Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, External Secrets Inc. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, or goodwill, arising from your use of the Service during alpha, beta, or early access phases.

7. **Termination**

   **Termination by You:** You may terminate your use of the Service at any time. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Service and remove the Agent from your infrastructure.

   **Termination by Us:** We may terminate your access to the Service for any reason, including violation of these Terms, with or without notice. Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.

8. **Changes to These Terms**

   We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or sending you a notification). Your continued use of the Service after any changes become effective means you agree to the new Terms.
